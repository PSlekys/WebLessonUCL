			<h1>Web Technology Tutorial for UCL</h1>
			<aside>
				Using <b>*SIMPLIFIED*</b> steps we will try to teach you everything a junior web developer should know. After this tutorial and HTML/CSS lessons, you should be able to get a junior front-end developer job! The course is supported by <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>.

		<h2>Previous &amp; future talks</h2>
		<p>
			After the previous lectures by <a href="https://twitter.com/lakatos88">Alex Lakatos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Teoli2003">Jean-Yves Perrier</a> and of course <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/stepanyan">Dr. Karen Stepanyan</a> you should be confident with:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Fundamentals of HTML/CSS;
				</li>
				<li>
					Firefox Developer tools.
				</li>
			</ul>
			This knowlegde will come in handy when preparing for future lectures, courseworks and exams. The main objective of today's talk is to quickly display the process of launching a simple website individually and comparing this to the processes a large organisation would undertake to launch a system. Most of the steps that we go over today will be taught (or were already taught) in more detail later in the course.

		<h2>Design a website</h2>
		<p>
			Before we start writting the code, we need to think about how the system will work and how should it look like to maximise consumer satisfaction. This involves considering User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
		</p>
		<p>
			We will use <a href="http://moqups.com/">Moqups</a> to put our thoughts down and wireframe the website. They will provide every UCL student with a basic account for free, just enter your email <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YxPHNOnqiKjB0MtP2">here</a> for an upgrade (you must already have an account there).
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's create a website wireframe about us! An example:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/website-wireframe.png" alt="Website Wireframe Template"/>
		
		<h2>Build a website</h2>
		<p>
			Now that we know exactly how the website should be structured, let's start writing HTML/CSS and make it a website. If you struggle and do not know how to begin, check <a href="#">this Github page</a>, where I uploaded a template of a website with plenty of comments.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Setup a server</h2>
		<p>
			<code>
				sudo apt-get update
				sudo apt-get upgrade
			</code>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Upload website to a server</h2>
		<p>
			Filezilla
		</p>
		
		<h2>Now you are a web developer!</h2>
		<p>
			By the end of this lecture you should now:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Basics of HTML/CSS;
				</li>
				<li>
					Wireframing;
				</li>
				<li>
					Basics of Server administration;
				</li>
				<li>
					Firefox Devloper Tools.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			Now you are ready... for a <b>Junior Front-End Developer Job</b>!!
