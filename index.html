			<h1>Web Technology Tutorial for UCL</h1>
			<aside>
				Using <b>*SIMPLIFIED*</b> steps we will try to teach you everything a junior web developer should know. After this tutorial and HTML/CSS lessons, you should be able to get a junior front-end developer job! The course is supported by <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>.

		<h2>Previous &amp; future talks</h2>
		<p>
			After the previous lectures by <a href="https://twitter.com/lakatos88">Alex Lakatos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Teoli2003">Jean-Yves Perrier</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/stepanyan">Dr. Karen Stepanyan</a> you should be confident with:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The fundamentals of HTML/CSS;
				</li>
				<li>
					Firefox Developer tools.
				</li>
			</ul>
			This knowlegde will come in handy when preparing for future lectures, courseworks and exams. The main objective of today's talk is to quickly display the process of launching a simple website individually and comparing this to the processes a large organisation would undertake to launch a new system. Most of the steps that we go over today will be taught (or were already taught) in more detail later in the course.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>
			Before we start this lecture, could you please ensure you aready have:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A text editor or IDE, we recommend* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>;
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php">Filezilla</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are running Windows: <a href="http://www.putty.org/">Putty</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					HTML/CSS basics: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Mozilla Developer Network</a>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Design a website</h2>
		<p>
			Before we start writting the code, we need to think about how the system will work and how it should look like to maximise consumer satisfaction. This involves considering User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). 
			<!-- The lesson on UI/UX best practices and frameworks is available <a href="#">here</a> -->
		</p>
		<p>
			We will use <a href="http://moqups.com/">Moqups</a> to put our thoughts down and wireframe the website. They will provide every UCL student with a basic account for free, just enter your email <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YxPHNOnqiKjB0MtP2">here</a> for an upgrade (you must already have an account there).
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's create a website wireframe about us! An example:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/website-wireframe.png" alt="Website Wireframe Template"/>
		
		<h2>Build a website</h2>
		<p>
			Now that we know exactly how the website should be structured, let's start writing HTML/CSS and make it a website. If you struggle (forgot what HTML or some elements mean - I_Forgot_Everything), don't know where to start or too lazy to begin HTML, check <a href="https://github.com/PSlekys/WebLessonUCL/tree/master/WebsiteTemplates">this Github page</a>, where I wrote templates of a website for people with different levels of knowledge.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Setup a server</h2>
		<p>
			Now that we have a website, we want it to be on the internet, not only on our computers. For this, we want to setup a server, which is a very powerful computer or even multiple computers.
			Let's create a VM (Virtual Machine) on Microsoft Azure and connect to it using <a href="http://www.putty.org/">Putty</a> (if Windows user) or through terminal for Mac and Linux:
			
			<code>
				ssh username@IPaddress
			</code>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now we want to install software on the server, which will host the website. The two main providers are <a src="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> and <a src="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>. In this tutorial we will be using Apache.
			First, let's update our server's packages. (sudo means granting root access - like 'run as administrator')
			<code>
				sudo apt-get update<br />
				sudo apt-get upgrade
			</code>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Install Apache
			<code>
				sudo apt-get install apache2
			</code>
			Yes, now we have a running server! To access the default server website, go to http://IPaddress
		</p>

		<h2>Upload website to a server</h2>
		<p>
			Filezilla
		</p>
		
		<h2>Is it different at a bigger corporation?</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, very much so and let's talk about why <a href="#">in this presentation</a> now! The main differences are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Many people work on the code, hence they use various collaboration tools and a distributed version control system (e.g. Git);
				</li>
				<li>
					They use automation servers (e.g. Jenkins) to pull data from a repositories (e.g. Github) and send an image to a registry.
				</li>
				<li>
					Due to the need for scalability (and the need for more than one server) they do not run VM as they are reasonably inefficient for such tasks - but rather use containers built from images (e.g. using Docker);
				</li>
				<li>
					To cope with huge demand from all over the world and multiple servers, they will have load-balancers with master/slave servers in a cloud infrastructure (in different regions).
				</li>
				<li>
					To ensure high level of security they use a combination of passwords and SSL certificates when connecting to servers.
				</li>
			</ul>
			A corporation will run extremely complex structures to ensure resource efficiency, flexible scalability and high availability & security.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Now you are a junior web developer!</h2>
		<p>
			If you paid attention in class today and know HTML/CSS, congratulation! You can now start searching for junior front-end developer roles to work in startups.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the end of today, we hope you know:
			<ul>
				<li>
					How to wireframe a website;
				</li>
				<li>
					How to code it in HTML/CSS;
				</li>
				<li>
					How to setup a basic server and launch your website;
				</li>
				<li>
					The differences between our approach and processes that a larger organisation would use.
				</li>
			</ul>
			We understand that some technical points are unclear, however, we hope you understood how things work. We will continue working on the technical knowledge to ensure fluency.
