		<h1>
			This is a heading! There are 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 - where h1 has the highest importance and h6 has the lowest.
		</h1>
	
		<p>
			This is text in a paragraph! Paragraphs are block elements, whereas <span>span</span> is an inline-element. 
			Imagine a block as a box, whereas an inline-element like a plastic bag - we can build various structures by putting a box on a box, whereas plastic bags either wrap-up content or sit next to each other. 
			Best way to figure out how they work is to play around with them!
		</p>
		
		<div>
			This is a section of the website - it also is a block element. Most websites contain many of these to create a solid structure. 
		</div>
		
		<p>
			Let's talk about a few inline elements. I am putting them in a paragraph to ensure that they are in a structured place rather than running around the website. 
			You can quickly notice that inline elements are displayed next to each other, rather than below each other (like blocks).
			<a href="https://google.com">For example, this is a link to Google!</a> and this is an image: <img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_120x44dp.png" alt="Google logo"/>
		</p>
	
		<div id="my-div-element">
			Yet another 'div' element. Just, I want this to be pink. So how could you differentiate this from the one above? Use class or id tags.
		</div>
		
		<div class="div-with-a-class">
			The main difference is that a class tag is mainly used in more than one element (if you want to apply the same style to many elements), whereas an id is to one element (e.g. only one div).
